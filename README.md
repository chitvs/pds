# Java client-server applications exercises

This repository contains client-server applications exercises from my university exams. Each exam folder includes the Java source code for the client, a compiled JAR server, and a PDF with exam instructions.

## How to compile and run
### Prerequisites
- Install Java
- (Optional) Use Eclipse to open the projects.

### Running the client
1. Navigate to an exam directory:
   ```sh
   cd src/16-07-2020
   ```
2. Compile the source files:
   ```sh
   javac -d bin *.java
   ```
3. Run the client:
   ```sh
   java -cp bin ClientMain
   ```
4. Run the server, if using the pre-built JAR:
   ```sh
   java -jar server.jar
   ```

## Notes
- These are my own exam solutions, so they may not be optimized but all of them work! ðŸ˜Š
